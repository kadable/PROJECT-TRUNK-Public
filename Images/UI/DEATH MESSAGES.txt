Ideas I had for random death messages:
A friendly MONOBROWBUG drags you to saftey, will you 
Wake up from your nightmarish dream and
Activate your latent time-travelling powers and
Get revived by the GOD OF TRUNKS TRONKUUS and
Let the GLASSESMEN heal your destroyed body and 
Take a sip of revive juice and
Retreat to your PLATFORMSHIP and then
The power of orange peels revive you, will you
Use sheer willpower to wake up and
Dissapear in a puff of smoke to the start and

TRY AGAIN?
