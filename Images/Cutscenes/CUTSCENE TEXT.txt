This was the old text for cutscenes for any people snooping in the game files. It changed in the process of making the cutscenes.

YOU ARE A TRUNKMAN
EXPLORER OF THE UNKNOWN
CHARTER OF THE UNEXPLORED
RECORDER OF THE UNDISCOVERED
YOU HAVE EVEN MORE TITLES THAT YOU CAN'T REMEMBER, BUT THEY BASICALLY MEAN THE SAME THING.

YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN A MISSION TO EXPLORE THE BEAK FOREST
(which is full of grouchy critters)
AND FIND THE MEANING OF LIFE.

You've been eating nothing but orange peels
(that's where all the nutrients are)
so you feel pretty prepared.

You even had the time to create a short film detialing your mission, in case you ever forget! (Trunkman in front of TV showing it to treebed)
YOU'VE ONLY JUST STARTED EXISTING SO YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE A GOOD IMPRESSION!

WHERE IS IT?
YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'VE EXPLORED THE WHOLE OF BEAK FOREST,
HAD THE MOST RATIONAL OF THOUGHTS,
TRAINED THE HARDEST YOU CAN
CHEWED THROUGH THE MOST ORANGE PEELS,
AND YET YOU CAN'T FIND THE MEANING OF LIFE!
IT'S NOT FAIR!
DEFEATED, YOU SAG AGAINST THE MUSHROOM.
...
YOUR BREATHES ARE HEAVY AND WHEEZY
YOU DIDN'T REALISE HOW TIRED YOU'VE BEEN.
...
FOR ONCE YOU CAN'T FEEL THE GLASSESMEN, ANALYSING YOUR EVERY MOVE
...
YOUR TRUNK RISES AND FALLS AS YOU BREATHE.
...
THE CLOUDS PART, AND YOU CAN HEAR A SWEET MELODY
AS THE MOUTHSUN RISES FROM THE HORIZON,
SINGING A SWEET TUNE.
...
THIS IS NICE.
