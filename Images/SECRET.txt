Woah what are you doing snooping in the games files???

Secret... hmmm... what's a good secret...

Oh I know. The TRUNKMAN you play as in PROJECT TRUNK's name is Brooks! Cool secret huh?

Hopefully I don't forget I added this secret to the game and accidentally rename them in a future game. If I do... then Brooks is their middle name!
